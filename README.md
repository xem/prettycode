Paste some minified / golfed code in the field, and this app will try to format it with the following constraints:

- Same length on every line (except the last)
- Avoid breaking words, HTML tags, numbers (123, 0.4, ...), operators (++, <=, ...)
- Avoid orphans (trailing characters, alone in the last line)
